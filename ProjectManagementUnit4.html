<p>Read the articles by Verner et al (2014) and Anton &amp; Nucu (2020) and then answer the following questions:</p>

<p>1. What are the main risks that the authors identify? How do these fit into the traditional SDLC model? 2. Which of the frameworks discussed in the Unit 3 lecture cast would you use to capture and categorise the risks? 3. Add a risk and a suggested mitigation to the module wiki. 4. Choose an entry made by one of your colleagues in the wiki and comment on how you might mitigate it.</p>

<p> Outsourcing risks owing to differing cultures, and the communication issues that may arise. This risk affects each part of the software lifecycle, but especially requirements gathering. Selecting the wrong vendor is an issue that starts early on. Requirements changing, which is a major problem towards the end as new issues are identified. Organisational silos become more of an issue as the project progresses.</p>

<p>2. I would use the Critical Path Method to evaluate these risks.</p>

<p>3. Organisational silos can be mitigated by outlining the dependencies of various aspects of the projects. And ensuring that problems are being discussed by all relevant departments.</p>
