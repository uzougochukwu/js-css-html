<p><br>The class diagram will support the object oriented design of this program. To help maximise security, each module will be independently checked for any malicious input. If one module produces unexpected bugs, the other modules should fail in a predictable manner. </br>
<br>The class diagram will ensure that we keep track of the hierarchy of inheritance amongst the objects in our program.</br>
<br>A sequence diagram is important, because this program will exhibit a considerable degree of cyclomatic complexity. The program must be able to run in a secure and insecure state, this necessitates the creation of two distinct programs.</br>
<br>The need to sanitise data after it is passed from one module to another and when it is inputted by end-users, makes it crucial to have a clear sequence of events in the program.</br>
<br>An activity diagram helps us to plan out our application from the user's perspective. The user needs to be able to login and logout, create an account (both secure and insecure) as well as performing various database querying operations. </br>
<br>It will be important to ascertain how the user will be prevented from viewing or modifying data that they do not have access permissions for. </br>
