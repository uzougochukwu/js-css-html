    <p>Question 1:</p>

    <p>Incentives mismatch</p>
    
    <p>Poorly defined requirements</p>
    
    <p>Incorrect choice of technology</p>
    
    <p>Question 2:</p>
    
    <p>Incentives mismatch - Wipro consulting &amp; the World Bank</p>
    
    <p>If a project is completed by an external consultancy, such as Wipro, they are not incentivised to state whether or not the project is viable. Case in point, Wipro bribed World Bank employees with Wipro shares in order to win multiple IT contracts. This led to Wipro being banned by the World Bank.</p>
    
    <p>Poorly defined requirements - Oracle &amp; Birmingham City Council</p>
    
    <p>Oracle specialises in business workflow systems, which differs greatly from a large local government. When the new IT system launched, the city council had to engage in a lengthy process of customisation. This made the system more fragile and it would be better if the requirements were implemented during the project itself.</p>
    
    <p>Incorrect choice of technology - Researchers Reinhardt &amp; Rogoff - Microsoft Excel</p>
    
    <p>Reinhardt &amp; Rogoff were writing a paper on the impact of government debt on economic performance. They chose to compute the results in Microsoft Excel and made a mistake by not copying down the formulas correctly. This led to them drawing an incorrect correlation between low levels of debt and strong GDP growth, when the results showed the opposite. The mistake was eventually noticed by a PhD student, long after the paper was published. A specialised statistical software program, such as STATA or SPSS, would have been more suitable.</p>
