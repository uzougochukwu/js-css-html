<p><br>What happens when the code is run?</br>

<br>It returns an indentation error.</br> 

<br>I amended the code by indenting the lines below the function definition.</br>
<br>Below is the final result</br>

<br>def factorial(n):</br>
  <br>""" Return factorial of n """</br>
  <br>if n == 0:</br>
    <br>return 1</br>
 <br> else:</br>
    <br>return n*factorial(n-1)</br>

<br>When flake8 is run on pylintTest.py, it warns that the indentations are not multiples of 4.</br>

<br>The cyclomatic complexity in sums and sums2 is caused by the if statement.</br>

<br>Yes, cyclomatic complexity remains relevant today. The multitude of branches that a program can take means that we must prioritise the most likely during testing.The FAA requires all software to be tested using the Modified Condition/Decision Coverage, this shows that cyclomatic complexity is important. </br>
