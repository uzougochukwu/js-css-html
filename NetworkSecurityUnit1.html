    <p>What do you consider as a fully digital enterprise?</p>

    <p>A fully digital enterprise is one where all aspects of information and communication are via computers.</p>
    
    <p>One potential definition of a fully digital enterprise relies on five main factors (Doherty 2017):</p>
    
    <p>The digital strategy must span horizontally across all departments All workflows are digitally transformed All partners who work with the business do so in a digital manner The enterprise integrates the digital capabilities of its partners A high proportion of transactions are attributable to digital projects</p>
    
    <p> What are the cyber security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</p>
    
    <p>The main concern is that in order for a digital enterprise to be convenient for employees and customers, you need to have a high level of information availability. The higher the level of availability, the less secure your systems become.</p>
    
    <p>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</p>
    
    <p>Everyone will want to continue following the same processes they have always followed. Nobody likes change. Some customers may be reluctant to use an online payments system, if they prefer cash. It may be difficult to show customers that their information will be safe with the business.</p>
    
    <p>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?</p>
    
    <p>I do not believe that digital transformation is of benefit to the majority of organisations. In many cases, the systems created are so complex that there is a reluctance to update and patch issues. Software approaches have a tendency to become bloated, databases are too frequently chosen over command line tools, simulation software is erroneously favoured over pen and paper calculations. As Robert Solow said, &ldquo;You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.&rdquo;</p>
