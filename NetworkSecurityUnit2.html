    <p>Main Vulnerabilities</p>

<p>Server Side Request Forgery</p>

<p>In this attack, the adversary modifies the URL in their web browser, in order to gain access to unauthorised information (Al-talak, K. and Abbass, O. 2021).</p>

<p>Cross Site Scripting</p>

<p>Cross Site Scripting involves sending a malicious javascript file to a website, which is then clicked by the victim (Gupta, S. and Gupta, B.B. 2015) .</p>

<p>SQL Injection</p>

<p>The attacker runs a sql script on the web server by typing malicious sql statements into the website&rsquo;s search engine (Shar, L.K. and Tan, H.B. 2013).</p>

<p> Did you have any issues or challenges with the literature search/audit on software sites and the national vulnerabilities database? No, there is plenty of information about web vulnerabilities. Though some explanations were vague. How did you overcome them? I overcame the issue of vague explanations by relying on previous knowledge that I have. How will they affect your final report? I do not expect these issues to affect my report, although it may cause me to focus more on the vulnerabilities that I am familiar with personally, such as SQL injection and cookie hijacking.</p>
